## Core Features:

- Secret Name Authentication: A minimalist landing page with a glassmorphism input field that requires a 'Secret Name' to unlock the application, triggering a beautiful transition upon correct entry.

- 'Yes' Button Animation & Confetti: The 'Yes' button dynamically grows in size upon interaction and triggers a celebratory confetti explosion when clicked.
